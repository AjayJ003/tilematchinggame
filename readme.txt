number of rows and columns must be decided by the user (default 6 x 6)

make proper matching of cards based upon user input and just disappear
these cards upon click) in the grid.

● In addition to the basic mode features, the game will also have power-up
cards with special abilities like

    ○ Freeze Card: This card freezes the timer for a certain amount of time,
                   giving the player more time to find matches.                     {COMPLETED}
    ○ Bonus Card:  This card gives the player a bonus point or points,
                   increasing their score.                                          {COMPLETED}

● The power-up cards will be randomly placed on the board. Once found, the
power-up card's effect will then be activated, and the player will be able to
use it for a limited amount of time, after that, the power-up card will expire,
and the player will have to find another one to use its effect again.
